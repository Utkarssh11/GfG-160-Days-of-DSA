# GfG 160 Days of Problem Solving

Welcome to my **GfG 160 Days of Problem Solving** repository! This repository contains my daily solutions to the **GeeksforGeeks 160-Day DSA Challenge**. I’m solving one DSA problem each day (or more) in a structured way, following the course's recommended roadmap to master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and to prepare for coding interviews.

## Course Overview
The **GfG 160 Days of Problem Solving** course is designed to help learners improve their DSA skills over 160 days by solving handpicked coding problems. These problems are focused on a variety of key topics such as Arrays, Strings, Sorting, Searching, and more. The course provides detailed articles, video explanations, and additional bonus problems to help reinforce the concepts.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Java
- **Algorithms**: DSA problems involving Arrays, Strings, Sorting, Searching, Graphs, Trees, and more.
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub for version control.

### Key Features:
- **160 Handpicked DSA Problems** on core topics.
- **90 Bonus Problems** with video solutions.
- **Completion Certificate** upon finishing the course.
- **Career Roadmap Sessions** covering Full-Stack Development, Data Science, DevOps, and more.

This repository will serve as a record of my daily progress as I work through these problems.

## Learning Roadmap
I will follow a structured approach for solving the problems. The general learning roadmap is:

- **Day 1-30**: Arrays, Strings, Sorting
- **Day 31-60**: Searching, Hashing, Matrix
- **Day 61-90**: Dynamic Programming, Two Pointers, Backtracking
- **Day 91-120**: Graphs, Trees, Heaps, Greedy Algorithms
- **Day 121-160**: Advanced Problems, Mock Interviews, and Recap

You can track my progress in the repository as I upload my daily solutions.

## Problem Solving Progress
Each day I will solve one or more problems and upload the solution in the corresponding day's folder. Here’s how the repository is organized:

### Repository Structure:
GfG-160-Days-of-DSA/
│
├── Day-1/
│   ├── Problem-1.java
│   
├── Day-2/
│   ├── Problem-2.java
│  
├── Day-3/
│   ├── Problem-3.java
│   
└── README.md


Each folder corresponds to a day in the **160 Days of Problem Solving** challenge. Inside each day's folder, you will find:

- **Problem Files** (e.g., `Problem-1.java`, `Problem-2.py`, etc.) containing the solution for the problem(s) solved that day.

## Assured Rewards
As I maintain my solving streak, I’m eligible to receive rewards from **GeeksforGeeks**, including a GeeksforGeeks T-shirt for consistent effort.

## Career Roadmap Sessions
In addition to solving problems, I’m also attending free workshops on trending technologies, including **Full-Stack Development**, **Data Science**, **DevOps**, and **Software Testing**. These sessions will help me broaden my skills beyond DSA.

## How to Navigate the Repository
1. Go to the `Day-X` folder for the solutions of that particular day.
2. Review the solution file (e.g., `Problem-1.java`) to see how the problem was solved.

## Conclusion
This repository will help me stay on track as I work through the **160 Days of Problem Solving** challenge. It also serves as a portfolio of my problem-solving progress for anyone who wants to follow along or for future reference.

Feel free to explore my solutions and check out my progress as I improve my DSA skills, get ready for coding interviews, and work towards mastering algorithms and data structures.
