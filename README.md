# GfG 160 Days of Problem Solving

Welcome to my repository for the **GfG 160 Days of Problem Solving** program! This repository contains my daily solutions to the handpicked DSA problems from the **GeeksforGeeks 160-Day DSA Challenge**. I am solving one DSA problem every day (or more, depending on the day) in a structured way, as recommended in the GfG course, to master Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and prepare for coding interviews.

## Course Overview
The **GfG 160 Days of Problem Solving** is a self-paced course aimed at improving your DSA skills by solving 160 handpicked coding problems over 160 days. Each problem comes with a detailed article and video explanation, along with bonus problems and solutions. It’s designed to help you learn DSA in a structured manner, perfect for coding interviews and career growth in tech.

### Key Features:
- **160 Handpicked DSA Problems** covering topics like Arrays, Strings, Sorting, Searching, Matrix, Hashing, Two Pointer Technique, and more.
- **90 Bonus Problems** with video solutions, adding up to **250 problems** for practice.
- **Completion Certificate** to validate your DSA skills upon successful completion.
- **Career Workshops** on trending tech topics like Full-Stack Development, Data Science, DevOps, and more.

## Learning Roadmap
Here’s how I plan to structure my learning:
- **Day 1-30**: Arrays, Strings, and Basic Sorting
- **Day 31-60**: Searching, Matrix, and Hashing
- **Day 61-90**: Two Pointer Technique, Prefix Sum, and Advanced Sorting
- **Day 91-120**: Dynamic Programming, Backtracking, and Greedy Algorithms
- **Day 121-150**: Graph Algorithms, Tree Traversals, and Heaps
- **Day 151-160**: Advanced Problems and Mock Interviews

I will push my daily solutions here, and if I complete more than one problem on a given day, I will include all solutions for that day.

## Problem Solving Progress
This section lists the problems I have solved so far, along with the corresponding topics and dates.

## Technologies Used
- **Languages**: Java
- **Algorithms**: DSA problems involving Arrays, Strings, Sorting, Searching, Graphs, Trees, and more.
- **Tools**: Git, GitHub for version control.

## Assured Rewards
By maintaining a consistent solving streak, I am eligible for exciting rewards from GeeksforGeeks, such as a GeeksforGeeks T-Shirt! 

## Career Roadmap Sessions
I will also be participating in free extra workshops covering trending tech stacks such as **Full Stack Development**, **Data Science**, **DevOps**, and **Software Testing**, to broaden my knowledge and gain insights into various tech domains.

## Conclusion
This repository serves as a record of my journey through the **160 Days of Problem Solving** challenge. I will continue to update it daily with my solutions to the problems, along with any insights or learnings I gather during the process. This journey will help me solidify my DSA skills and prepare for coding interviews.

Feel free to browse through the repository, check out the solutions, and follow along with my progress. If you're also participating in this challenge, feel free to reach out, discuss problems, and share your learning!
